## ‚úÖ Current Achievements (Already Done)

This section summarizes the work completed to date, including the features that are implemented, although some require adjustments.

* **Initial Payment Integration with PayPal:** Payment functionality has been implemented using PayPal's React libraries (`paypal-react`), allowing transactions to be processed within the application.
* **ATH M√≥vil Implementation:** The ATH M√≥vil payment method has been added as an option for users, including the initial logic for its operation.
* **Liquid Glass Interface Design:** A custom visual style known as "Liquid Glass ios26" was developed and applied, giving the app a unique, fluid iOS aesthetic.
* **Base Application Structure:** The main architecture of the app is established, allowing for navigation and basic component management.

The key languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies being used are specified here. This information is crucial to understand the project's development environment.

* **Main Language:** **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Framework:** **React Native** (This explains the need to manage styles for iOS and Android).
* **Payment Libraries:**
* `react-paypal-button-v2` (or the specific library you are using for `paypal-react`).

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Plans

This is the roadmap of the critical upcoming tasks for the development and improvement of SubliGraphic.

* **1. User Interface (UI) Fix and Evolution:**
* **Immediate Priority:** Investigate and fix the rendering bug in the **"Liquid Glass ios26" style on Android**.
* **New Goal:** Deprecate the "Liquid Glass" style and migrate the entire user interface to **Material You (Material Expressive 3)**. This will unify the design, modernize it, and ensure a consistent, native experience, especially on Android.

* **2. PayPal Integration Refactoring:**
* Audit and **repair the `paypal-react` implementation**. The goal is to ensure that the payment gateway is 100% stable, functional, and error-free on all platforms (iOS/Android).

* **3. Restore PayPal Component:**
* **Re-implement the "box" or visual container** that sits above the ATH Movil "box" or "visual container." This component is crucial for guiding the user and must be visible and functional as in previous versions.
