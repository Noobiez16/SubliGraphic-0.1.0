## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-12

### Added
- **AI-Powered Design Generation:** Integrated a generative AI model allowing users to create unique, custom images from text descriptions directly within the application.
- **Interactive 360Â° Product Preview:** Implemented a realistic, spritesheet-based 360-degree rotating mockup for users to visualize their custom designs on products before purchasing.
- **Custom Product Integration with Cart:** Enabled users to apply their generated designs to base products (mugs, tumblers) and add these personalized items to the shopping cart.
- **Simulated Checkout Flow:** Built a complete, multi-view checkout process featuring an order summary, multiple payment options, and an order confirmation screen.

### Changed
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Refined the AI generator's user flow with a smoother loading state and improved the overall navigation from design creation to purchase.
- **State Management:** Introduced a centralized view management system (`currentView`) in `App.tsx` to handle navigation between the store, cart, checkout, and confirmation pages.

### Fixed
- **LocalStorage Quota Errors:** Refactored cart persistence logic to store large custom image data separately, preventing storage overflow errors and allowing multiple custom items to be saved.
